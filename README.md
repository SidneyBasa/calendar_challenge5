# calendar_challenge5
A calendar application that uses the Day.js API to display the date

## Description
The website is able to load and display the date using the day.js API
The save buttons on each time slot are detected in the application
However I allocated insufficient time to complete the saving of the data to the web application
I have come to terms with the possibility of quiting my job as a security guard to spend more time in the bootcamp.
